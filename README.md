Matt's Display of Drupal Concepts
---------------------

This repo has basic implementations of concepts loosely based on things I've had to do in the past.

###  Concepts portrayed
- Extending the node class
- Using the Ajax Api
- Making a webform handler
- Generating content types and fields on module install
- Using routes and controllers
- Importing CSVs and converting them to nodes
- Batch Processing
- Twig Templating
- Block Plugins
- Grabbing data from logged in user
- Configuration Forms

### User Greeting Module
**Located in /modules/custom/user_greeting**

The user greeting module adds a block plugin that displays last login time and greets the user.
Add it to the sidebar region in the block layout editor and edit the greeting (optional) at /admin/config/user-greeting/settings
